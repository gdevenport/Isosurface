# Isosurface
This is my code that will read in h5 files and create vtk files to be read by paraview including the velocity and vorticity.

Isosurface_single.jl is to be used to convert a single h5 file into a vtk file to be used as an isosurface.

Isosurface_multiple.jl is to be used to convert an entire folder of h5 files into vtk files with the same file number to be used as isosurfaces.
